# Plots 
This folder is subject to changes over different runs, as new plots are routinely produced and overwritten. Experiment-specific plots produced by ``visuals.py`` are located in ``processed/``, while more informative visualizations produced by the main scripts are in ``general``.

## ``general`` plots
Here we provide annotations and commentary on each plot in ``general/``.
